# Project_2
This is Project 2 for Rice Cyber Security Bootcamp

In the second project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both a pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 

As the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs to extract hard data and visualizations to create reports.

Finally I interpreted log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that was performed.
